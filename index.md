This is the homepage for the 4th workshop on 'Networks in Science of Science' (NetSciSci), which will be held in Boston, USA, on the afternoon of June 1st, 2026, as a satellite event of [NetSci26](https://www.netsci2026.com).

# Overview

Networks are particularly useful data representations for Science of Science., which connect various elements in the scientific community, such as scientists, institutions, journals, conferences, patents, and funding agencies. NetSciSci serves as an annual forum for presenting new developments in the application of network methods to the study of Science of Science. We will have both invited talks and contributed talks. We welcome research related to **the analysis of relevant network data** (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks, knowledge graphs), **the development of novel methods** (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction, causal inference, interactive visualization), and **experimentation with representations** (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). We encourage diverse perspectives and seminal work targeting **under-explored** topics related to Science of Science.

As organizers of NetSciSci, we are committed to community building and fostering a new generation of Science of Science researchers. We hope to provide a platform for junior researchers, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and pre-tenure professors, to disseminate their work. One paper, led by a graduate student, will be recognized with a Best Student Paper Award. We also organize a networking lunch/dinner to help participants connect.

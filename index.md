# Overview

This is the homepage for our [NetSci 2025](https://netsci2025.github.io/) workshop on 'Networks in Science of Science', which will be held in Maastricht, the Netherlands on June 2nd to 6th 2025.

# Background

The vast amount of research articles, datasets, grant proposals, and patents produced by scientists provide a rich digital trace of the scientific ecosystem. These data are the foundation of an emerging field called the **Science of Science**, which aims to understand the evolution of science in a quantitative manner. This field has the potential to bring significant benefits in terms of scientific, technological, and educational advancement. Networks are a useful and intuitive tool for understanding the connections between various elements in the scientific community, such as scientists, institutions, journals, conferences, ideas, theories, and funding agencies. 

This satellite symposium aims to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to reflect the diverse community that can drive (and benefit from) scientific innovation. We have both invited talks and contributed talks. These talks will showcase the use of network science in the field of Science of Science. This includes the analyses of relevant network data (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks, knowledge graphs), development of novel methods for science of science applications (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction), and experimentations with representations (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). In addition, we seek submissions in the developing areas of exploration concerned with the impact of diverse voices and intellectual backgrounds, political policies, and intelligences (including Artificial Intelligence) on scientific advancements. This satellite also provides a stage for junior researchers such as graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors to disseminate their work. One paper led by a graduate student will be recognized for a Best Student Paper Award. 

Our symposium is a continuation of previous successful NetSci satellites: "Networks in Science of Science" (NetSci 2023 & 2024), "Science of Team Science & Innovation" (NetSci 2022), and "Knowledge Networks in Science and Technology" (NetSci 2017). Taking advantage of the location of NetSci 2025, we will involve researchers from the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University, a renowned research center in quantitative studies of science.

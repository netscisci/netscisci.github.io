# Overview

This is the homepage for our [NetSci 2026](https://www.netsci2026.com) workshop on 'Networks in Science of Science', which will be held in Boston, USA on June 1st, 2026.

# Background

The vast amount of research articles, datasets, grant proposals, and patents produced by scientists provides a rich digital trace of the scientific ecosystem. These data form the foundation of Science of Science, a field seeking to understand the evolution and betterment of science in a quantitative manner. Science of Science has the potential to bring significant benefits in terms of scientific, technological, and educational advancement for human societies.

Networks are particularly useful data representations for Science of Science., which connect various elements in the scientific community, such as scientists, institutions, journals, conferences, patents, and funding agencies. This satellite symposium serves as an annual forum for presenting new developments in the application of network methods to the study of Science of Science. We have both invited talks and contributed talks. We welcome research related to the analysis of relevant network data (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks, knowledge graphs), the development of novel methods (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction, causal inference, interactive visualization), and experimentation with representations (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). We encourage diverse perspectives and seminal work targeting under-explored topics related to Science of Science.

This satellite symposium also aims at community building and fostering a new generation of Science of Science researchers. It provides a platform for junior researchers, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and pre-tenure professors, to disseminate their work. One paper, led by a graduate student, will be recognized with a Best Student Paper Award. We also organize a networking lunch to help participants connect.

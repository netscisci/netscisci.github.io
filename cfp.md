# Call for Papers

Please join us in beautiful Maastricht this June for the “Networks in Science of Science” workshop, a satellite of [NetSci25](https://netsci2025.github.io/). We invite researchers and practitioners to share their work on the use of network approaches applied to studies in science of science. We particularly encourage submissions from **junior researchers**, including graduate students, postdocs, and pre-tenure professors. We will award a **Best Student Paper Award**, recognizing the best submission led by a graduate student(s). We will host a **networking lunch** following the morning workshop. 

**Scope**

We welcome submissions that explore the use of network approaches applied to studies in science of science. This includes (but is not limited to): **the analyses of relevant network data** (e.g., citation networks, collaboration networks, semantic networks, knowledge graphs), **development of novel methods for science of science applications** (e.g., graph embedding, link prediction), and **experimentations with representations** (e.g., hypergraph, multilayer graph). In addition, we seek submissions in the developing areas of exploration concerned with **the impact of diverse voices and intellectual backgrounds**, **political policies**, and **intelligences** (including Artificial Intelligence) on scientific advancements. 

The theme of submission this year is “**Science and Society**.” Submissions closer to the theme will be particularly welcome. The program committee will review the abstracts for the acceptance as either a contributed talk or a lightning talk in the spring. The Best Student Paper Award will be voted on at the workshop by the audience. Submissions cannot be those presented orally at other sessions in NetSci.

This workshop does not have archival proceedings. Therefore, submissions can be:
- recently published (2024-2025)
- under peer review (e.g. papers published on arxiv or SSRN)
- works in progress
  
**Submission Format**

_Option 1:_ Submit a PDF file of your publication or preprint. This option requires minimal work and is suitable for authors having no copyright restrictions or other concerns that prevent them from uploading their paper/preprint to a different site. 

_Option 2:_ An abstract. The file should be a PDF. We suggest 1 to 3 pages with unlimited pages for references and figures, but you are free to go beyond 3 pages. You can use any template of your choice.

**Submission Portal**

Enter your submission on EasyChair [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=netscisci2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=netscisci2025). The portal and any updates to CFP can be found on the workshop website: [https://netscisci.github.io/cfp](https://netscisci.github.io/cfp)

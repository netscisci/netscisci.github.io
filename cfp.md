# Call for Papers

We welcome submissions that explore the use of network science in the field of Science of Science. This includes (but is not limited to) topics such as the analysis of:
- citation networks
- collaboration networks
- semantic networks
- knowledge graphs
- time-varying graphs
- hypergraphs
- multi-layer graphs
- link prediction
- graph mining
- graph embedding

In addition, we seek submissions in the developing areas of exploration concerned with the **impact of diverse voices, intellectual backgrounds, and intelligences (including Artificial Intelligence) on scientific advance**. 

This workshop does not have archival proceedings. Therefore we explicitly welcome submissions that are:
- new empirical work
- recently published papers
- under peer review (e.g. papers published on arxiv or SSRN)
- early drafts and work in progress

The program committee will review and vote on acceptance in the spring, as well as Best Student Paper Award.

## Format

Please submit your abstracts in pdf format to [Openreview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NetSci/2024/Workshop/S4S).

To encourage submission of work at every stage, we do not impose any length limitations. They can also be written using any template, in latex or word. However, if you are writing something from scratch, a 1~3 page extended abstract (with unlimited pages for references and figures) is good enough for us.
